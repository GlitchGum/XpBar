## **XP Bar Goal Tracker ðŸš€**

Ever wanted to turn your to-do list into a video game? This little C++ console app does just that! It's a simple but powerful tool I built to track goals and gamify the process of getting things done. As you complete steps, your EXP bar fills up, giving you that satisfying sense of progression.

It's perfect for anyone who loves seeing their hard work pay off visually and wants a fun way to stay motivated.
